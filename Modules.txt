                      Python:
      Modules:
              Modules are used  to burrow someone else's code. 
              With the help of modules we can use someone else's code
              in our program.
      Kinds of Modules:
       There are 2 kinds of Modules:
       01: Built-in Modules:
                Built-in Modules are the modules  which ship along 
                 with the Python Programming Language which means 
                 that we don't need to install them externally.
       02:External Modules:
               External Module is a code written by people and they 
                want you to use their code in your Python Program.
               (External Modules are installed using pip. Pip is a package
                manager, it install whatever the module you ask for from the
                internet in your Python interpreter.)
       Why we use Modules:
              We use Modules because we don't want to code basic programs 
               from scratch.
              The code written in Modules is well-tested and is written by 
               experts.
            Many people have used it so there are very less chances for error.
            It save your time and efforts which you can use to work on some
             bigger projects.
